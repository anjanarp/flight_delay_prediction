The flight data is segmented into subfolders for the years 2016 and 2017, create a folder for each year and keep all the relevent 
csv foles from each subfolder in its respective year. Include the file path to these two folders in datapreproc.ipynb to run the 
data preprocessing code. 
Download the weather data code. No restructuring is needed other than the filepath to the weather directory to run the 
datapreproc.ipynb (data preprocessing) code.

When running the models, if you want to do so without running the preprocessing steps, follow the link to the merged data link to download the final dataset with data cleaning and merging done.
